# Retail-Customer-Segmentation-KMeans
Implement K-Means clustering to segment customers based on purchase history (e.g., recency, frequency, monetary value). Analyze segments to tailor marketing strategies.

This project implements a K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers of a retail store based on their spending behavior and demographic information. Customer segmentation is a crucial step for businesses to understand their customer base and design personalized marketing strategies. By analyzing customer data, this project groups individuals into distinct clusters that represent similar purchasing behaviors.

The dataset used contains key attributes such as Gender, Age, Annual Income (k$), and Spending Score (1-100). These features serve as proxies to represent customer behavior in the absence of detailed purchase histories. Using these features, the clustering algorithm groups customers into meaningful clusters that can help businesses identify different customer profiles, such as budget-conscious buyers, average spenders, and premium customers.

Key steps in the project include:

Data Preprocessing:

Encoding the categorical feature Gender into numeric form for analysis.
Scaling the data using StandardScaler to standardize the features, ensuring fair distance-based comparisons in K-Means.
Optimal Cluster Determination:

The Elbow Method and Silhouette Score were used to determine the optimal number of clusters, balancing cluster tightness and separability.
Clustering and Visualization:

The K-Means algorithm was applied with the chosen number of clusters.
Visualizations, such as scatterplots, depict the clusters based on their spending patterns and income levels, providing insights into customer groups.
Evaluation:

The clusters were evaluated to ensure meaningful separations, offering actionable insights for targeted marketing campaigns or business strategies.
This project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in business and marketing. It provides a foundation for retail stores to better understand their customers and make data-driven decisions to improve customer engagement. The repository includes well-documented Python code, data preprocessing steps, clustering analysis, and visualizations.

Future improvements could involve incorporating more detailed purchase history data (e.g., transaction logs or product categories) to refine customer segmentation further. This project is ideal for beginners and intermediate data scientists interested in learning clustering techniques and applying them to real-world problems.
