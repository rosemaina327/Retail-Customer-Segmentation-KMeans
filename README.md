## Project Overview
The project is a part of Task 1 of the Prodigy InfoTech internship and includes:

- Preprocessing raw data for cleaning and feature preparation.
- Building a Linear Regression model enhanced with Polynomial Features to capture non-linear relationships.
- Evaluating the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²).
- Visualizing model accuracy with scatter plots, residual plots, and histograms.
- Saving predictions to a well-structured CSV file.

## Features
### Data Preprocessing:
- Handling missing values and outliers.
- Log-transforming skewed data for better model performance.
- Encoding categorical features and scaling numerical features.

### Model Training:
- Using Linear Regression with Polynomial Features for non-linear relationships.

### Visualization:
- Plots for evaluating model performance and residual errors.

### Predictions:
- Final house price predictions saved in a CSV file with essential columns.
